# DCA-MySQLProject
Storing local cricket club data into MySQL server using python.

Note that MySQL connection details are not defined for security reasons. This code is designed to work for the DCA website (https://dca4u.com/Statz/Overall/cstr74.htm).

This code uses the concept of web scraping to retrieve data from tables on the DCA (Dhahran Cricket Association) website and manipulate the data to make new tables. This data is then uploaded to the MySQL server. After the data has been uploaded, we can then make queries to create meaningful statistical analysis for teams and players to analyze.
