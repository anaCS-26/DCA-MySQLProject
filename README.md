# DCA-MySQLProject
Storing local cricket club data into MySQL server using python.

Note that MySQL connection details are not defined for security reasons. This code is designed to work for the DCA website (https://dca4u.com/Statz/Overall/cstr74.htm).

This code uses the concept of web scraping to retrieve data from tables on the DCA (Dhahran Cricket Association) and manipulate the data to make new tables. This data is then uploaded to the MySQL server.
